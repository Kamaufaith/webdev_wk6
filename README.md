# Interactive Web Pages with Javascript

## Overview
This project demonstrates the basics of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and form validation. 
It’s divided into three main parts that build upon each other from simple interactions to dynamic web components and input validation.

### Part 1: Event Handling
Learned how to use event listeners to respond to user actions such as:
- Button clicks
- Mouseovers
- Keyboard input
#### Features:
Clicking a button shows or hides a message.
Hovering over text changes its style.
Typing in an input updates displayed text in real-time.

### Part 2: Form Validation
Built a simple form that validates user input before submission.
#### Features:
- Checks for empty fields
- Validates email format using regular expressions
- Ensures password meets security requirements
- Displays error messages or success feedback dynamically

### Part 2: Interactive Elements
Used event listeners and DOM manipulation to create engaging features.
#### Example Interactive Features:
- Light/Dark Mode Toggle – Switch between light and dark themes
- Collapsible FAQ – Show or hide answers by clicking questions
- Dropdown Menu – Expand or collapse navigation options
